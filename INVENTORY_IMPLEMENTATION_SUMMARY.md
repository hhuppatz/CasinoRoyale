# Inventory System Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

A comprehensive inventory system for players with the following features:

### ‚úÖ Core Features
- **3 Fixed Item Slots**: Players can hold up to 3 different item types
- **Item Stacking**: Multiple instances of the same item type stack in one slot
- **Smart Slot Management**: New item types automatically fill the first available slot
- **Auto-Collection**: Coins are automatically collected on contact
- **Manual Pickup**: Swords and other items require pressing **E** to pick up
- **Item Usage**: Press **I** to use items (behavior varies by item type)
- **Item Dropping**: Press **Q** to drop one item from inventory

### üèóÔ∏è Design Patterns Used

#### 1. Factory Pattern
- `IItemFactory<T>`: Generic interface for creating items
- `CoinFactory` and `SwordFactory`: Concrete implementations
- `ItemStrategyFactory`: Creates appropriate strategies for each item type

#### 2. Strategy Pattern
- `IItemUseStrategy`: Interface defining item usage behavior
- `CoinUseStrategy`: Handles coin usage (gambling, purchasing)
- `SwordUseStrategy`: Handles sword usage (attacking)
- Allows different items to have unique behaviors without modifying core code

#### 3. Interface Segregation Principle
- `IPickupable`: For items that can be picked up
- `IUsable`: For items that can be used
- `IDroppable`: For items that can be dropped
- Items implement only the interfaces they need

### üìÅ New Files Created

#### Interfaces (3 files)
1. `Classes/GameObjects/Items/Interfaces/IPickupable.cs`
2. `Classes/GameObjects/Items/Interfaces/IUsable.cs`
3. `Classes/GameObjects/Items/Interfaces/IDroppable.cs`

#### Strategies (4 files)
1. `Classes/GameObjects/Items/Strategies/IItemUseStrategy.cs`
2. `Classes/GameObjects/Items/Strategies/CoinUseStrategy.cs`
3. `Classes/GameObjects/Items/Strategies/SwordUseStrategy.cs`
4. `Classes/GameObjects/Items/Strategies/ItemStrategyFactory.cs`

#### Player Classes (1 file)
1. `Classes/GameObjects/Player/InventorySlot.cs`

#### Documentation (2 files)
1. `Classes/GameObjects/Player/INVENTORY_SYSTEM_README.md`
2. `INVENTORY_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (this file)

### üîß Modified Files

#### Major Updates
1. **`Classes/GameObjects/Player/Inventory.cs`**
   - Completely rewritten with 3-slot system
   - Methods: `TryAddItem()`, `TryRemoveItem()`, `HasItem()`, `GetItemCount()`, etc.

2. **`Classes/GameObjects/Player/PlayableCharacter.cs`**
   - Added inventory instance
   - Added E, Q, I key input handling
   - Added methods: `TryPickupNearbyItems()`, `TryDropItem()`, `TryUseItem()`
   - Added auto-collection for coins
   - Added 50-unit pickup range

3. **`Classes/GameObjects/Items/Coin/Coin.cs`**
   - Implements `IPickupable`, `IUsable`, `IDroppable`
   - Auto-collected (no E key required)
   - Uses `CoinUseStrategy` for behavior

4. **`Classes/GameObjects/Items/Sword/Sword.cs`**
   - Implements `IPickupable`, `IUsable`, `IDroppable`
   - Requires E key to pick up
   - Uses `SwordUseStrategy` for behavior

### üéÆ How It Works

#### Picking Up Items
1. Player walks near an item (within 50 units)
2. **Coins**: Automatically collected on contact
3. **Swords**: Player presses **E** to pick up
4. Item is added to first available slot or stacked if already owned
5. Item is removed from world and marked as destroyed

#### Using Items
1. Player presses **I**
2. System finds first occupied inventory slot
3. Executes the item's use strategy (via `ItemStrategyFactory`)
4. Item count remains unchanged (use doesn't consume items)

#### Dropping Items
1. Player presses **Q**
2. System finds first occupied inventory slot
3. Removes one item from that slot
4. Spawns the item in the world at player position
5. Item is tossed forward with some velocity

### üß™ Example Flow

```
Player starts with empty inventory [empty, empty, empty]
‚Üì
Player walks near a coin ‚Üí Auto-collected
Inventory: [COIN x1, empty, empty]
‚Üì
Player picks up another coin ‚Üí Stacks in existing slot
Inventory: [COIN x2, empty, empty]
‚Üì
Player presses E near a sword ‚Üí Manual pickup
Inventory: [COIN x2, SWORD x1, empty]
‚Üì
Player presses I ‚Üí Uses coins (triggers CoinUseStrategy)
Inventory: [COIN x2, SWORD x1, empty] (count unchanged)
‚Üì
Player presses Q ‚Üí Drops one coin
Inventory: [COIN x1, SWORD x1, empty]
Coin spawns in world with forward velocity
‚Üì
Player presses Q again ‚Üí Drops last coin
Inventory: [SWORD x1, empty, empty]
(Slot cleared when count reaches 0)
```

### üöÄ Extensibility

Adding new items is straightforward:

1. Create new item class implementing desired interfaces
2. Create new use strategy class
3. Register strategy in `ItemStrategyFactory`
4. Create item factory
5. Register factory in `ItemManager`

No changes needed to core inventory or player code!

### ‚ú® Key Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Item behavior is separated from inventory logic
2. **Easy to Extend**: New items can be added without modifying existing code
3. **Type Safety**: Uses enums and interfaces for compile-time safety
4. **Flexible**: Different items can have completely different behaviors
5. **Maintainable**: Clear structure and documentation
6. **OOP Best Practices**: Implements Factory, Strategy, and Interface Segregation patterns

## Testing Checklist
